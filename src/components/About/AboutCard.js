            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Ibrahim Saqib </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Islamabad, Pakistan.</span>
            <br />
            I am currently in my 7th Smester of Bachelors in Computer Science.
            <br />
            Right now, Iâ€™m seeking industry experience to further hone my abilities and work alongside experts. My long-term goal is to gain hands-on experience, grow professionally, and eventually start a venture of my own.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
          </p>

            <li className="about-activity">
              <ImPointRight /> Football
            </li>
            <li className="about-activity">
